This program calculates the distance a suspended object falls given a user input gravity constant and time.
'''

import math

print("This program calculates the distance a suspended objects falls", "given a gravity and time")
gravity = input("Enter gravity in pixels/s^2 : ") #Get gravity from user
gravity = float(gravity) #Convert string to float
fps = input("Enter game's FPS : ") #Get fps from user
fps = int(fps) #Convert string to int
number_frames = input("Enter the frame number : ") #Get number of frames from user
number_frames = int(number_frames) #Convert string to int
time = number_frames / fps #Calculate time object is falling
distance = 0.5 * gravity * time**2 #Calculate distance in pixels object has fallen
print("It will drop", distance, "pixels in", time, "seconds")
